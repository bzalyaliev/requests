### How to run

1. Idea:

* Run RequestsApplication class as usual
* Build frontend-for-backend running from the root dir: `sh ./infrastructure/rebuild-frontend-for-backend.sh`
* Enjoy at http://localhost:8080

2. As standalone jar

* Build it
```shell
./mvnw clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true

java -jar ./target/requests-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

* Enjoy at http://localhost:8080
